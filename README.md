# Data-Scraping-using-Selenium
The project is to develop a web scraping program that extracts relevant data from target websites. Web scraping involves automated extraction of information from web pages, and this project aims to utilize this technique for collecting specific data points for analysis or storage.
I used Selenium for Scraping Web Pages and to print the extracted data into the .txt files.
